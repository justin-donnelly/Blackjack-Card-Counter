# Blackjack-Card-Counter
Using OpenCV and an image classification model that I trained, I used my webcam to record a live feed of me drawing cards from a deck of playing cards. The code then captures a picture of the card, classifies it, and then counts the cards one by one.

model.ipynb includes the code needed to download a card dataset from kaggle, as well as two models that I trained using the Fastai library. Image_detecion.ipynb is the file that shows the use of OpenCV. You can view a live video demonstration below:
